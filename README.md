# SQL-Projects

This repository contains my sql projects. SQL is a very powerful language and is an essential part of any data analyst role. Using SQL allows us to query databases and tables, and is an integral part of the ETL process. Here are some of the steps I take when dealing with data using SQL:

- Exploring data and understanding how tables are related
- Building Schemas
- Importing data via command line (it's so much more faster than some import wizard tool)
- Transforming and doing some cleaning:
  - Dealing with Null Values
  - Eliminating duplicate records
  - Creating new fields that will be essential for calculations
- Writing relevant queries

## Projects:

- European Football Data:
  - What are the different leagues available and where are they from?
  - Goals scored by home team vs away team Season on Season
  - Matches won each season
  - Most Successfull Teams of all time
  - And more..
- Indian Premier League(IPL) Data:
  - Total Avg runs per ball by match
  - Top Performing Batsmen -> 50's and 100's scored by Player
  - Top Bowling Figures: Bowlers and Highest Wickets
  - Bowling Statistics
  - And more..
